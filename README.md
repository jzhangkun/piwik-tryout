## Apache Initial Configuration
By default the Apache installation doesnâ€™t have the PHP directives configured so it necessary to add them to the httpd.conf file

Within Vi search for the LoadModule section and add the following line 
```
LoadModule php5_module /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/libphp5.so

```

Search for AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml within the file and under that line add
```
<FilesMatch \.php$>
SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
```

To disable Directory Listing search for Options and change the following line

```
	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks 
```
To
```
	Options FollowSymLinks
```

To enable automatic redirecting to the Piwik home page search for Redirect and add the following lines in
```
RedirectMatch ^/$ /piwik/index.php
RedirectMatch ^/piwik/$ /piwik/index.php
```

This will redirect the top level root URL to the piwik default page.
